With this Python project, we will be making a drowsiness detection system.
A countless number of people drive on the highway day and night. 
Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance
suffer from lack of sleep.
Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive when feeling sleepy.

The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. 
So, to prevent these accidents we will build a system using Python, OpenCV,
tensorflow and Keras which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy.

OpenCV – pip install opencv-python (face and eye detection).
TensorFlow – pip install tensorflow (keras uses TensorFlow as backend).
Keras – pip install keras (to build our classification model).
Pygame – pip install pygame (to play alarm sound).

1. Download dataset from kaggle link given in Important link file.
2. Prepare your data using "data_preparation.ipynb" program.
3.Train your data using "ml_model_training.ipynb" file.
4.Test your model using "ddmain.ipynb" file.






I will provide further update stay tune.
